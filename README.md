# WhatsappBlockerWithMessages

I didn't create this script; it already existed. I simply added a 'for' loop to run it again when it finishes.

Regarding the script: I use it to freeze the WhatsApp application when scammers send links or messages.

To use it:

Open the chat in Web WhatsApp.
Press F12 and go to the Console tab.
Paste the script into the console
